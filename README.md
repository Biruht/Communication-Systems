# Communication-Systems

Project Aim:
For my final project, I am  interested in exploring Matlabâ€™s Communication Toolbox which has interesting algorithms, simulations and verification of communication systems. I chose to implement the Automatic Meter Reading system. This is an example that  shows how to use Communications Toolbox to read utility meters by processing Standard Consumption Message (SCM) signals and Interval Data Message (IDM) signals which are emitted by Encoder-Receiver-Transmitter (ERT) compatible meters. You can either use recorded data from a file, or receive over-the-air signals in real time using an RTL-SDR or ADALM-PLUTO radio.
